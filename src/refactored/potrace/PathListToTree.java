    /* Give a tree structure to the given Path original.potrace.List, based on "insideness"
    testing. I.e., Path A is considered "below" Path B if it is inside
    Path B. The input pathlist is assumed to be ordered so that "outer"
    paths occur before "inner" paths. The tree structure is stored in
    the "childlist" and "sibling" components of the path_t
    structure. The linked original.potrace.List structure is also changed so that
    negative Path components are listed immediately after their
    positive parent.  Note: some backends may ignore the tree
    structure, others may use it e.g. to group Path components. We
    assume that in the input, point 0 of each Path is an "upper left"
    corner of the Path, as returned by bm_to_pathlist. This makes it
    easy to find an "interior" point. The bm argument should be a
    Bitmap of the correct size (large enough to hold all the paths),
    and will be used as scratch space. Return 0 on success or -1 on
    error with errno set. */
